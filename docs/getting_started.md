# Getting Started

The **Variational Learning Playground** is an experimental space for testing variational learning methods. It is built upon the `variational-learning-benchmark` (`vlbench`) toolkit, which provides the core benchmarking engine and standardized interfaces.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Hydra-Powered Configuration**: All tasks use [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for flexible configuration and overrides. See the [Hydra Quickstart Guide](hydra.md) for details.
2. **Standardized Interfaces**: Whether you are training an MLP on UCI or a ResNet-50 on ImageNet, the interfaces remain consistent.
3. **Reproducibility**: Benchmarks are designed to be run across multiple seeds, with aggregation scripts provided.

## Basic Workflow

Most tasks in `vlbench` follow this pattern:

1. **Setup**: Install dependencies as described in [Installation](installation.md).
2. **Train**: Run a training script for your desired method/model/dataset.
   ```bash
   uv run python -m vlbench.<task_area>.train method=... model=... dataset=...
   ```
3. **Evaluate**: Run the corresponding test script.
   ```bash
   uv run python -m vlbench.<task_area>.test traindir=...
   ```

For more details on using `uv` for environment management and running scripts, see the [UV Guide](uv.md).
